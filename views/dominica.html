                    <p>Growing up on the Caribbean island of Dominica, I learned to appreciate nature from a young age. As soon as I was old enough to learn, my father taught me how to scuba dive, and I immediately fell in love with it. It didn’t hurt that
                        the Soufriére-Scotts Head Marine Reserve, with some of the best diving in the world, was a stone’s throw from my porch. </p>
                    <p>Prior to diving I never had more than a passing interest in photography, but when I discovered this whole new underwater world, I felt driven to capture its beauty as best I could. I spent years trying to learn every little trick and
                        strategy from my father to improve both my diving and my photography. One time I spent the entire dive lying on the sand, trying to get the perfect shot of a seahorse, to no avail. After thousands of photos of practice and probably
                        over a hundred total hours underwater, I’ve reached the point where I end dives with maybe three photos worth sharing.
                    </p>
                    <p>Since I couldn’t always be underwater, I started to practice photography on land. Even though it wasn’t quite as lively and interesting as the sea, it did have a certain appeal. One day I was browsing a photo magazine, and saw an amazing
                        photo of the stars. Inspired, I took my camera out on the porch that night and started snapping away. It took some figuring out, but I was amazed by how well it worked, and how clear the Milky Way was! I was surprised to find that
                        star photos are almost as fun to take as underwater photos.
                    </p>
                    <p> This past summer, I went on a family trip to South Africa. It was an amazing experience, and really put my surface photography to the test. Despite none of it being underwater, there were always amazing opportunities for photos in
                        the bushveld. I was so special to have the chance to get pictures of animals that I had never seen in person before. Learning photography has been quite a journey for me, but well worth it! Here are some of my favourites. Enjoy!
